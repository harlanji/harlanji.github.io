<p class="MsoNormal">The other night I did some tinkering and got Soashable + xmpp4js building with Maven2 (without JSLibBuilder). Basically what I did was create some ‘war’ artifacts for scriptaculous + prototype, extjs, and xmpp4js (none are checked in yet). I also created one for soashable-web that depends on xmpp4js.<br /><br />Basically the dependency tree looks like this:<br /><!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>  <ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">soashable-web<o:p></o:p></li><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">xmpp4js<o:p></o:p></li><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="square"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">extjs<o:p></o:p></li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">scriptaculous<o:p></o:p></li></ul></ul><li class="MsoNormal" style="">extjs<o:p></o:p></li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">scriptaculous<o:p></o:p><br /></li></ul>  <p class="MsoNormal"> I have a preliminary way to run the JSUnits on xmpp4js (though I'd really like to just create a plugin, probably based on Selenium), and hopefully the Selenium plugin works as advertised.<br /><br />This means I’ll need to open up a repository for the soashable-web, xmpp4js and js dependency artifacts, and at that point one will be able to build soashable-web with a single mvn jetty:run command on the checkout. In the longer haul, hopefully I can sync up with the central repository and extjs/scriptaculous will create and maintain their own artifacts.<br /><br />It's a little ghetto at this point. The projects are war projects and the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/war-overlay.html">overlay</a> happens 1:1 over the war (may be possible to override, but I don't want to look into it now), so a standardized tree under src/main/webapp will need to be used; js/xmpp4js/..., js/extjs/..., etc. However there is a little hope for JS development on the horizon; <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg73453.html">just yesterday a maven jstools library was checked in to CVS</a>.<br /><br />If I can get JSUnit working, this stuff should be in by late tonight or tomorrow evening. Matt and I will be working tonight.<br /><br />On a side note, it would be cool to start something like '<a href="http://jsrepo.com/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">jsrepo.com</a>' as a public maven2 js library repo. At the very least, I’ll contact the authors of extjs et all.<span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:10;"  ><o:p></o:p></span></p></div>
