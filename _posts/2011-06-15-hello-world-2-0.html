Hello again.  I'm back in the real world with a shiny new Computer Science degree, after three grueling years of hard work. I've relocated to the SF Bay Area from Minneapolis in search of greener pastures. I accepted a position with a startup, <a href="http://emota.net/">Emota.net</a>, and am now working with Node.js and Redis. I'm still getting on my feet out here, but I'll be resuming business as usual as I explore the Node ecosystem. Cheers!</div>
