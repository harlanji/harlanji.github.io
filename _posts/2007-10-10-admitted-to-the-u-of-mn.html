I applied to the U and just learned that I was accepted for Spring semester, CLA Pre-CS. Not that it's a really hard school to get into, but for somebody with an academic background like mine it's one hell of an achievement. It was the last step in officially clearing my name and turning my academic career around. From here on, I have the same opportunity as a 'normal' student--even a good grad school is on the table, if I keep working hard.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone for all the support.</div>
