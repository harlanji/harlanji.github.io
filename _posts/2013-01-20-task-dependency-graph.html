<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mgy2gz1sqx1qa3yi0o1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>Just to give you an idea of how I think about these things, here&#8217;s a picture of my project.</p>
<p><span>This format is called a &#8220;<strong>task dependency graph</strong>&#8221;, and I have adapted it myself to show iterations and completion.</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Dark outlined circle (libspotify example) is completed. </span></li>
<li><span>Arrows are dependencies. </span></li>
<li><span>"Critical path" is the longest chain of work, </span>
<ul><li><span>"compile mixxx &lt;- mixxx library example &lt;- mixxx libspotify plugin" for this example. </span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span>The stuff below the wavy line is the next iteration.</span></li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Sidebar thought:</strong> I notice that often times when I explain this stuff to people I realize I have lots of formal methods and tools that I use without realizing it&#8230; when I explain I have to dig up names and analogies by which they were taught to me, so I should try to explain things to people as much as I can. the old idea &#8220;the best way to learn is to teach&#8221; incarnate.</span></p>
<p><em>But then I turned this into a blog post, because I don&#8217;t blog enough. </em></p>
