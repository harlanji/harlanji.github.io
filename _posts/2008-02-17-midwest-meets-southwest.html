I made up an awesome dish, today, from left-overs! It's not software development, but it is development, no less.<br /><br />Slather some mashed potatoes on a tortilla, and throw some chopped chicken breast and nacho cheese on; leave unwrapped, cover with a paper towel and microwave for about a minute. Top it with some sour cream, salt, pepper and salsa. Wrap it up and enjoy!<br /><br />Remember: always use safe food preparation practices.</div>
