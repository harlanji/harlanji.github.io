I haven't mentioned it on this blog, but my colleagues know I've been serious about learning J2EE and I'd just like to report to them here that it's going phenomenal. After just a few weeks I feel pretty comfortable that I know what's up in the land of Java and Enterprise development.<br /><br />My new intermediate skills include (in order):<br />Cocoon component development<br />Hibernate<br />Profiling web applications w/ JMeter and Cocoon profiler<br />JUnit<br />Apache Ant<br />Apache Axis<br /><br />The past weeks have been packed with learning goodness, and I'm pleased to say that the coming months should be equally fulfilling; especially now that I have a handle on the roles of the seemingly 100s of Java technologies.<br /><br />Christmas is coming up, here are some great gift ideas: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go/002-1669553-0667221?%5Fencoding=UTF8&type=wishlist&amp;amp;amp;amp;id=2XMYPYL6Q94GE&amp;sort=priority">my amazon wishlist</a>.</div>
