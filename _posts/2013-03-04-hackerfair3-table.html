<p>Overall a VERY fruitful day at Hacker Fair. I found some <span>interesting freelance/part-time leads, and two great while yet very different</span><span> companies in the city who I&#8217;d love to work with.</span></p>
<p>One is small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business">lifestyle business</a> with an amazing vacation package, and 20% time for personal open source development! <span>The other is a growing household-name company who seems to encourage employees to have a life outside of work, and share it (think: show and tell). AWESOME.</span></p>
<p><span>I am strongly considering both as models to compare similar opportunities to; I am not sure which arrangement I will prefer, but this has me very excited for the future. I would love to return to either in a few months.</span></p>
<p>Of course everyone who put it on and participated on both sides of the table were awesome; <strong>big thanks!</strong></p>
<p>For example:<span> even if a recruiter and I found right away that it was not a good fit, they were friendly and continued the conversation about my project/their company before moving on. A very nice change of pace!</span></p>
