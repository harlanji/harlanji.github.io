<p>Back story: I dressed sexy and then spilled coffee all over myself. I&#8217;m going to a social event tonight and still wanted to look sexy, but not do a whole load of laundry.</p>
<p>I used my regular detergent (powder rather than liquid) in a large bowl under the bathroom sink. I used rubber gloves and just swished it around and rubbed a little until all the spots were gone. I improved the pit regions as well, while I was at it!</p>
<p>I rinsed 2-3x, until the water stopped being soapy, and hand wrung.</p>
<p>I am drying inside because I live downtown and vagrants wander into my yard; <span>they take lemons from the tree&#8212;fine by me, I&#8217;m not eating them. but if they were to take something else, I&#8217;d be pretty disappointed. so I&#8217;ll just not give them the chance, and we can live in harmony.</span></p>
<p>the shirt is almost completely dry (wearable) after less than 30 minutes. also, I can see a light vapor pattern in the sunlight shining on my desk; it&#8217;s pretty cool looking.</p>
