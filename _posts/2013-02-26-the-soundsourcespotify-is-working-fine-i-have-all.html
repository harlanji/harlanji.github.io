I have all spotify sounds say they are in &#8220;/tmp/music.spotify&#8221; for now, and my source handles &#8220;.spotify&#8221; files. I will either make physical files with metadata for each track, or I will need to more tightly integrate with the SpotifyFeature.</p>
<p>I opted to extend SoundSourceSndFile for now since it is the path of least resistance, but I have a more proper design in mind that uses delegation like SoundSourceProxy.</p>
