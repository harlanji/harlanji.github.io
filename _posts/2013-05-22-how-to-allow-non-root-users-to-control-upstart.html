<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/390687/upstart-allowing-a-normal-user-to-stop-and-start-my-custom-service">How to allow non-root users to control Upstart services, without a sudo password prompt.</a><br/><p>The snippet that I&#8217;m using is here, but this will apply to running any privileged command without a password:</p>
<pre><code>youruser ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/start yourservice, /sbin/stop yourservice, /sbin/restart yourservice</code></pre>
<p>I did not previously know that sudoers allowed rules at the argument level, though I&#8217;d used NOPASSWD before. <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/sudoers.man.html">The man page</a> is pretty packed with usage info, and it appears there is a lot to learn. For today, a lot of things I&#8217;d been doing with my deployment scripting should get a lot  easier :).</p>
