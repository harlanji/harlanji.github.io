Seems like a good time to be thinking about the topic of Javascript development tools.<br /><br />Here's an interesting thread on the Maven Users' list that started yesterday:<br /><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg73451.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg73451.html</a><br /><br />and my contribution to it:<br /><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg73613.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg73613.html</a><br /><blockquote></blockquote><pre><blockquote style="font-family: times new roman;">It looks like there is a good array of tools coming to light from this<br />thread. I, myself, have been tackling the problem of making JS library<br />development more like Java development, as far as automated running of unit<br />tests, documentation, packaging, etc, in recent months.<br /><br />I see a growing demand for a nice tool chain of things like jslint,<br />shrinksafe, jsunit + jscoverage, selenium, jsdoc, and dependency management.<br />Maybe it's because I just came back to JS after several years with a bunch<br />of Java development under my belt; but I see all these tools and feel like<br />they should be integrated. Especially when I make the connection between<br />web2.0 and people who promote Agile development practice. JS tools are<br />hardly in the state to accommodate good Agile, IMO. If integration were<br />better, it would be a different story.<br /><br />My original approach was to create an Ant script that would download various<br />things using the &lt;get&gt; task, and use Maven Antlib for JSUnit, Selenium and<br />ShrinkSafe dependencies. But now I am getting to the point where I want to<br />break my library into multiple parts (project-core, project-ext,<br />project-ext-gui, etc) and Maven seems like the natural answer. And of course<br />when Maven comes into the picture, I want to manage my other JS dependencies<br />as such.<br /><br />So last night I gave it a shot, and it seems to work well using war<br />packaging and their built-in overlay behavior. There are a few kinks to work<br />out, and probably Mojos to write, but I think it will work.<br /><br />My immediate need is for JSUnit, which I have hacked into a series of<br />executions (see pom link below). I'll definitely be looking at some of these<br />tools and seeing how I can use them (namely the ShrinkSafe mojo!), and<br />hopefully getting a JSUnit mojo out of them at the very least. I've never<br />written a plugin (beyond hello world), but I'm eager to give it a shot.<br /><br />I have high hopes that Maven can bring the state of JS development up to par<br />with the Agile way that so many web2.0 people want to develop. I'm looking<br />forward to hearing more of everyone's great ideas!<br /><br />Harlan<br /><br />ps.<br />Here's my main POM with JSUnit (in-progress proof of concept, by no means a<br />final product). The executions for JSUnit are basically a copy of<br />Selenium's:<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://soashable.googlecode.com/svn/xmpp4js/branches/maven/pom.xml">http://soashable.googlecode.com/svn/xmpp4js/branches/maven/pom.xml</a><br /><br />And here's my old Ant script "JSLibBuilder":<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://soashable.googlecode.com/svn/jslibbuilder/trunk/">http://soashable.googlecode.com/svn/jslibbuilder/trunk/</a></blockquote><a rel="nofollow" href="http://soashable.googlecode.com/svn/jslibbuilder/trunk/"></a></pre><br />Adios!</div>
