<div class='post'>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this post is a work in progress.</span><br /><br />As an exercise for my book, Enterprise Ruby on Rails, I will be creating a workflow based implementation of the iBatis Petstore application. It will use <a href="http://openwferu.rubyforge.org/">OpenWFE4ru</a> (aka Rufus) and <a href="http://www.globalize-rails.org/globalize/">Globalize</a>, and be fully unit and integration tested. It will contain no added GUI sweeteners, as it is meant to display best practices; convoluted AJAX code will just get in the way of that. I may base it on an older version of Rails Petstore (before it got mixed up with AJAX), or start from scratch--further evaluation is necessary.<br /><br />Aside from those key points, it will be a typical Petstore application. I've created the designs and begun exploring necessary tools, however I have an exam to prepare for next week. But I'll find time soon.</div>
