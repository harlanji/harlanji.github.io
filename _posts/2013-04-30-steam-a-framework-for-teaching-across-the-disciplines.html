<a href="http://www.steamedu.com/">STEAM: A Framework for Teaching Across the Disciplines</a><br/><p>Despite the throwback website, we need this&#8212;check out the video!</p>
<p>The way few non-CSE departments at <a href="http://umn.edu">the U</a> would touch STEM concepts and courses in CSE rarely touched non-STEM, was just wrong. STEM is what the world is made of, and Art can mostly be taught with STEM roots.</p>
<p>I think both &#8220;sides&#8221; of Art + STEM need to converge and work toward each-other. I&#8217;m excited to watch Korea&#8217;s implementation of STEAM!</p>
