<p><span>I am super impressed by these things, and others. I still mean to explore Angular more, as I was previously excited by it. I am pretty sure Ember is my way forward. Backbone was awesome for its time, but on to Ember!</span></p>
<ul><li><span>a good comparison to AngularJS, that exposes the philosophies: </span><a href="http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/angularjs-vs-emberjs/1029/4">http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/angularjs-vs-emberjs/1029/4</a></li>
<li><span>a good intro video to using EmberJS (about 30 min): </span><a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">http://emberjs.com/guides/</a></li>
</ul><div>I am interested in integrating with <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> for static typed foundation, and a module loading system (perhaps AMD), doing some static analysis on the statically typed code, blending with some magic sauce, and then serving it all up using Node. I feel this would be pretty comparable to Go and perhaps easier to transition to from people with existing Node investments.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Update:</strong> TypeScript has support for external definitions of existing JS files; the <a href="https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped" title="DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project provides them for many major projects including Bootstrap and Ember!</div>
