<p>I&#8217;ve tried apple crisp and now mint chocolate, both are stellar 2 minute bursts of &#8220;realistic&#8221; flavor. they&#8217;ll not replace the real thing for sure, but these could go SO FAR for people with an occasional sweet tooth.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they can literally replace desert after a meal; but I think they are good for the occasional nights I wish I had sweets. these hit the spot!</p>
<p>I am of course weary of what kinds of mood altering chemicals might be in these things, but I&#8217;m not much less worried about commercially produced deserts from the freezer asile anyway. </p>
<p>for now it seems to be a price worth paying, but when my weight stabilizes (or I am bulking) I will surely opt away from these artificial crutches.</p>
