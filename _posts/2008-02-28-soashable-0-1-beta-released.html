<a href="https://soashable.com/">Soashable</a> is an Open Source (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soashable/">on SourceForge</a>) web-based, multi-protocol instant messaging client written in pure Javascript. It connects to an XMPP/Jabber server using BOSH (XEP-0124), which is a COMET protocol that provides instantaneous transport of messages between the web browser and XMPP network. It is supported in all major browsers, and currently has core IM features including messaging and roster management.<br /><br />Soashable is Open Source because I believe that any one or any company should be able to creating a competing product, in a cooperative way, as this raises the user experience bar for everyone. I hope it serves as the base for research of web-based UIs, public-facing commercial applications, internal communication applications, and tools in every niche imaginable. XMPP truly is the future of online communication, and finally, I am proud to be able to provide you with yet-another-tool that utilizes it. It's been a LOT of work, but it's finally here!<br /><br /><a aiotitle="" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eS8rwzJcHas/R8eZp69TI8I/AAAAAAAAAC0/VT4FHFlFd3Y/s1600-h/soashable-web2.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eS8rwzJcHas/R8eZp69TI8I/AAAAAAAAAC0/VT4FHFlFd3Y/s320/soashable-web2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172271642538353602" border="0" /></a><a aiotitle="" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_eS8rwzJcHas/R8eZpq9TI7I/AAAAAAAAACs/IThmFJTK3c8/s1600-h/soashable-web.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_eS8rwzJcHas/R8eZpq9TI7I/AAAAAAAAACs/IThmFJTK3c8/s320/soashable-web.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172271638243386290" border="0" /></a><br />Soashable is the test bed for my recently released Xmpp4Js library, <a href="http://xmpp4js.sourceforge.net/">available on SourceForge</a>.<br /><br />I hope my work is used in ways that I could have never thought of!<br /><br />This release is far from perfect and needs a lot of polish, so all feedback is welcome and appreciated. Please use the bug tracker liberally! It is located here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/soashable/issues/list">http://code.google.com/p/soashable/issues/list</a> . But I am confident that she will be ready for MinneBar (I just hope I can get a presentation slot; nudge nudge, anyone with hookups)!<br /><br />You can either try it out online at <a href="https://soashable.com/">https://soashable.com</a> (self-signed cert, safe to ignore warnings), or you can download a stand-alone version that is runnable with nothing more than a 1.5+ JVM. That is available through SourceForge, here:<br /><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=217403&amp;package_id=262062"> http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=217403&amp;package_id=262062</a><br /><br />Simply download and click run.bat. If you're on mac or linux, use the command:<br /><br />java -jar lib/start.jar<br /><br />I haven't tested it on unix, so please, somebody let me know if it works before I officially perform a release with an sh file.<br /><br />For you hard core people out there, here is the Maven site with info about how to check the project out of SVN and start hacking:<br /><br /><a href="http://soashable.sourceforge.net/">http://soashable.sourceforge.net</a><br /><br />Again, this release needs plenty of polish, so please let the bug tracker be your best friend.<br /><br />Happy Hacking!</div>
