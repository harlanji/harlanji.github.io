Last year, I made a site called "<a href="http://www.lookmiiup.com/">lookmiiup.com</a>" that's for looking up a person's <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> number (like an ICQ# for a Wii; used to add friends and other stuff in the future) by identifiers like AIM name, phone number, etc. Yea, it's all but dead; I still have a release that I haven't done because of time / lost steam :(. Thinking about the new <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Platform</a>, why can't a Facebook member ID be an identifier? And why not have it broadcast to your mini-feed when you register your Wii, and list all of your registered friends when you go to the LookMiiUp application?<br /><br />The Wii has a fairly small market though; only about 2.75m units sold in the US. However, I'd guess that 50-75% of that number have Facebook accounts. <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/791/791089p1.html">Nintendo projects 35m units in the US by 2012</a>, and it seems reasonable given the price gap and target demographics of the Wii vs. Xbox360 and PS3.<br /><br />It would need more interesting features than just saying "here's who has a Wii" though; what games they have, or something. But even then, what's the incentive for them to add their stuff aside from it being shiny? Probably not much. Honestly I don't even think I'd use it :(<br /><br />The other problem is making money; I doubt that it would ever make dollars. It might give a launch pad for future applications though, simply by giving an audience to market future ideas to or simply for credibility.<br /><br />Thoughts?</div>
