I'm happy to hear this news and glad they waited until they were ready for their numbers to be official. Article: <a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/soup/archives/postgresql-publishes-first-real-benchmark-17470">here</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>    This publication shows that a properly tuned PostgreSQL is not only as fast or faster than MySQL, but almost as fast as Oracle (since the hardware platforms are different, it's hard to compare directly). This is something we've been saying for the last 2 years, and now we can prove it.<br /><br />...<br /><br />   The difference in cost, per pricing given by Tom Daly, is much more substantial than the difference in performance. Our benchmark run costs about $65,500 for the hardware, and has no software acquisition cost. Based on retail price listings, however, the Oracle/HP run costs $74,000 for the hardware and $110,000 for the software. That's a almost 200% more expensive. Add annual maintenance and support and it becomes even greater.<br /><br />   So effectively, you can still get slightly better performance by using Oracle on commodity hardware. You just pay $120,000 to gain an incremental amount of performance. But then, you already knew that, didn't you?</blockquote></div>
