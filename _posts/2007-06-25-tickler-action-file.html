<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-tickler-action-file.html">A post on LifeHack</a> today described a possibly more efficient variation of a <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Tickler_file">Tickler file</a>. Rather than sorting by day, they suggest sorting by action. I agree completely and just started using a similar approach last week. I use Outlook tasks with the Categories field, and a Group By in the view. The result looks like this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_eS8rwzJcHas/RoF-l6QDAeI/AAAAAAAAAAU/yhgM5-SiaeE/s1600-h/outlook-task-categories.gif"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_eS8rwzJcHas/RoF-l6QDAeI/AAAAAAAAAAU/yhgM5-SiaeE/s320/outlook-task-categories.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5080481044407452130" border="0" /></a><br />It supports multiple categories (works the same as tagging), due dates, reminders and attachments. I can attach emails <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_value#Call_by_reference">by reference</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_value#Call_by_value">by value</a>, and even "assign" the task to other via email if I need to. The copy machine also supports scanning documents to e-mail, which fits into the mix in perfectly. So-far it's working out quite nicely.</div>
