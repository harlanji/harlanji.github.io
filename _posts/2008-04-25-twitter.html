Along with <a href="http://goatzebra.blogspot.com">Clayton</a>, I hesitantly signed up for <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. Social broadcasting is something that I don't yet understand; well, I should say I don't see as useful; but I'll give it an honest try.<br /><br />I remember the days when people made fun of LiveJournal because people posted about mundane things like eating a delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I think I'm stuck at web 1.5.<br /><br />Hit me up: <a href="http://twitter.com/harlanji">http://twitter.com/harlanji</a>.</div>
