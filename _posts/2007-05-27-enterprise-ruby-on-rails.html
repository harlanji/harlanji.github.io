<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

Various things over the past few weeks (MinneBar, discussions, encouragement) led me to put together an outline for a Ruby on Rails book/wiki. Basically, it would explore challenges that are relatively uncharted on the RoR platform, but are well known among .NET / Java folks. Up to this point I have not used Rails, but I'm not closed to the idea of using it--in a lot of ways, compiling this knowledge would serve as a Q&A session for me :), and hopefully help out others. The intent is to compile it to a wiki and baseline a book, to be released under creative commons attribution; this way work can carry on after I've gotten the answers that I want ;).<br /><br />It is available <a href="http://trac.devspan.com/entror">here</a>.</div>
