<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the past few weeks I have been updating my frontend web skills. While building an EmberJS+Bootstrap based portfolio, I came across TimelineJS which loads data from Google Spreadsheets! It was the first time I had seen such a trick, and naturally I wanted to figure out how it works.</span></p>
<p class="p1">I did some research and found that it&#8217;s as simple as making a JSONP request; just replace the cryptic portion of the URL below with your document&#8217;s key. Hint: your document&#8217;s key is the part between key=&#8230;&amp; in the address bar while you&#8217;re looking at the document.</p>
<p><span>This translates pretty simply into this jQuery snippet:</span></p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">$.ajax({
  url: "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/0AlNlwgTVXeETdEozaVRfZ0Itb0lvanZFMUFFTkg4RGc/od6/public/basic", 
  data: {alt: "json-in-script"}, 
  dataType: 'jsonp'}
).then(function(resp) {
</code>
</pre>
<p>From there, you can do as you wish with the cells in the response!</p>
