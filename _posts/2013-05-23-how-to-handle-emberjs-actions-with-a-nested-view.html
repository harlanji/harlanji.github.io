<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11887836/handling-action-in-view-not-router">How to handle EmberJS actions with a nested VIew, rather than the parent Route.</a><br/><p>This isn&#8217;t hard or hacky, just confusing to a n00b. Views and Routes have events added to them differently, but the real trick is that actions don&#8217;t seem to hit the view from whom&#8217;s template they originated.</p>
<p><strong>View</strong></p>
<pre><code>App.RequestQuoteView = Ember.View.extend({
  templateName: '_requestQuoteView',

  sendRequest: function(e) {
    alert("I should be triggered! from View.");
  }

  });</code></pre>
<p><strong>Route</strong></p>
<pre><code>App.ProjectRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return {};
  },<br/><br/><strong>events: {</strong>
    // I am only here for illustration, and do not need to exist.<br/>    sendRequest: function(e) {
      alert("I should not be triggered! from Route.");
    }
  }
  });</code></pre>
<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<pre><code>&lt;button {{action sendRequest <strong>target="view"</strong>}} class="btn btn-primary btn-large"&gt;Send Request&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This works because &#8216;view&#8217; is a valid property of the controller; an instance of RequestQuoteView. I do not fully understand how things are wired up in the hierarchy, but it seems pretty analogous to anything else with bubbling handlers. <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/views/inserting-views-in-templates/">See this guide page</a>, under relative paths for some more info&#8212;though it&#8217;s fairly incomplete; maybe there is some better event documentation out there?</p>
