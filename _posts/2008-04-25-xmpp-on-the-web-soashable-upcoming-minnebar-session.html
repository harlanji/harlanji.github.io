I'll be hosting a session at <a href="http://barcamp.org/MinneBar">MinneBar</a> this year: "XMPP on the Web: Soashable" on Saturday May 10th, at Coffman Union; it's FREE. I've never done anything like this, so hopefully they get out the free beer early ;).<br /><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">XMPP on the Web: Soashable</span><br /><br />Soashable is a web based, Open Source, multi-protocol instant messenger based on XMPP(Jabber) using BOSH (XEP-0124 and 0206); it is similar to Meebo. XMPP is anything from an IM protocol to a poor-man's middleware solution. Subject matter will range from technical details of XMPP and Soashable, to high level discussion of Jabber and standardization, to direction of the Soashable project.<br /></blockquote><br />Even if you don't come to my session, be sure to check out MinneBar if you're in the area. Last year it had an awesome turn out (I think I heard it was the biggest BarCamp ever), and the MinneDemos throughout the year have become more and more popular (though sometimes the presentations have reflected that... people market/seek VC rather than sharing interesting ideas). The unconference style gets some great conversation outside of the sessions going; I've never had a problem joining any conversation that's sounded interesting.</div>
