<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-bundle">git bundle</a> create /tmp/myproject.bundle &#8212;all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will bring all tags, branches, and heads along for the ride in a single file that can be archived without worry. To restore it, you simply clone from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>git clone /tmp/myproject.bundle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it! It should be possible to create incremental bundles as well, but I didn&#8217;t need that.</p>
