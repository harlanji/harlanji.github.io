Xmpp4Js is an XMPP client written in pure Javascript. It connects to a server using BOSH (XEP-0124), which is a COMET protocol that provides instantaneous responses.<br /><br />It allows any web page to be active on an XMPP network. Uses can range from a simple Meebo-like chat client, to a phpLive-like support interface, and beyond.<br /><br />Xmpp4Js is supported in all major browsers, which removes compatibility limitations inherent in browser extensions like xmpp4moz.<br /><br />The initial release includes a sample chat client with basic in-browser messaging functionality, and all dependencies.<br /><br />Xmpp4Js is dual-licensed under LGPL and Apache 2.0. It is available for download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=209465&amp;package_id=251329&amp;release_id=579308">here</a>.</div>
