<p>granted the UI locks for the length of the song the first time it is loaded, afterward it works perfectly. I will play around with various structures to support something like producer consumer with seeking; quite likely I&#8217;ll use mmap, and then seek+music_delivery will adjust the starting pointer. I don&#8217;t know what to do if the full track was not materialized&#8212;quite likely discard it.</p>
<p>feels good!</p>
