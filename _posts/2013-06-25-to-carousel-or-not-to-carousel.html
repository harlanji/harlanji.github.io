<a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/">To carousel or not to carousel?</a><br/><p><span>I think this is a good discussion of website carousels and their types and uses, and good practices for each:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span>While About pages are extremely important, I’m afraid they don’t belong in any sort of carousel – so you can forget that. Remember that each type has a distinct purpose:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><strong>Content</strong> provides fresh content for visitors to consume</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Information</strong> tells a story, all slides are linked to one subject</li>
<li class="li1"><strong>Navigation</strong> segments your visitors, getting them into your conversion funnels</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Many anecdotes</strong> around the web seem to say things to the nature of &#8220;carousels are useless&#8221; or &#8220;ignored,&#8221; and may even &#8220;look like adverts,&#8221; with little good to be said:</p>
