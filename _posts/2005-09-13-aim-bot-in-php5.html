<span style="font-weight: bold;">Objective:</span><br />Create a simple bot that handles events from AOL instant messenger and is able to be manipulated at runtime.<br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;" >Projects utilized:</span></span><br />JabberD 1.4.3<br />AIM Transport 20040131.b<br />PHP 5<br />Class.Jabber.PHP 0.4.2<br />PostgreSQL 7.4.7<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outcome:</span><br />Success, it was up and running within 10 minutes. The JabberD and AIM-t infrastructure was already in place from one of my previous projects. I needed to do some discovery of the Jabber class, due to lack of documentation; I'm not happy with its desgin overall. But this project proves how easy it is to make IM agents.</div>
