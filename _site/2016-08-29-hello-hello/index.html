        <p>It’s been a couple of years since I’ve written an update. I get very focused.
So what have I been focusing on?</p>

<p>In future posts I’ll dig deeper back in my notes and commit logs to see what I was doing. For now I’ll focus on what’s in memory, which is basically 2015 to now.</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>Since going to University I’ve become 1) much more of a reader, 2) Much less of a writer and doer. I’m getting better at doing again, I realize the importance of both thinking and doing. During the first leg of my career I was entirely a doer, and I liked to write about it when I got confident. I would read as little as possible and brute force solutions. Once I went to the U I learned to read endlessly for each assignment and solve very abstract problems.</p>

<p>I afterward joined a startup where I had free reign to implement as I saw fit with no market pressure, so I remained very heady. There were deliverables where doing was required, but it was very much an R&amp;D role. I spent a lot of time working self-directed before I took a role where I had to consistently ship. I remained a reader and could do when I needed to, but my curious spirit had very much faded.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve been heads down doing for the past few years… here are some of the ideas I might expand upon:</p>

<p>How has my approach evolved?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Much more homework before I try something</li>
  <li>Thinking about monetization – no plan often stops me, limited time and resources.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stream-processing">Stream Processing</h2>

<p>Built a dense system built on Apache Samza. Maintained current landscape for about 6 months during 2014-2015 while designing a streaming compute platform.</p>

<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>

<p>Built a production system and presented architecture to Samza User Group.</p>

<h3 id="edn">EDN</h3>

<p>EDN should be a successor to JSON.</p>

<p>Supports core CS data structures.</p>

<p>Supports list, vector, set, map… JSON only supports string=&gt;* map and collection.</p>

<h2 id="language-design">Language Design</h2>

<p>Implemented a subset of SQL using Antlr. The grammar supported sub-queries but the compiler did not support that. Could join streams in test but not production. Super advanced, similar to Esper.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-runtimes--systems">Distributed Runtimes / Systems</h2>

<p>Created prototypes using major Mesos frameworks and started implementing a system on top of Nomad. Used Zookeeper in production and theoretically understood how to could be used to realized functionality in new distributed systems.</p>

<h2 id="low-latency-audio-systems">Low Latency Audio Systems</h2>

<p>Only recently started along this vein as I started building myself a home audio system. There are a huge number of applications in my personal life given how many musicians I know and spaces where music can be played. Knowing how to measure and reduce latency is king. Knowing where latency is introduced in the pipeline helps. But interestingly, audio streams are just data streams with a fixed bandwidth and tight latency constraints.</p>

<h2 id="container-systems">Container Systems</h2>

<p>Docker is one way to do containers, and it deserves credit for making the idea popular. But I’ve been doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">chroot jail</code>s since I was in high school, even though I didn’t understand them at the time. I avoid Docker where possible but there are some things it’s just good enough at to warrant an <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get install</code>.</p>

<h1 id="domain-driven-design">Domain-Driven Design</h1>

<p>Less a technology, and more a new way of slicing up problems. I think it’s a superset to OOD, in that particular Bounded Contexts may benefit from OOD. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design#Relationship_to_other_ideas">Wiki seems to agree</a>.</p>

<h1 id="event-based-systems">Event-based Systems</h1>

<h1 id="lean-startup">Lean Startup</h1>

<p>Read Eric Ries’ book shortly after it came out. Read a couple other Lean family books and went to a Lean Unconference.</p>

<p>Seems like a lot of things for a “focus” but they all fit together. I’ve worked on a number of smaller projects as well:</p>

<h2 id="overtone">Overtone</h2>

<p>Music generation is something I haven’t ever thought to do, but while living with classical musicians in a house with a midi connected piano, I was also knees deep in build event based systems and analytics systems.</p>

<h2 id="personal-org-systems">Personal Org Systems</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">org-mode</code>! I thought I was invention and aggregation a lot of personal org ideas into the best organization system ever built. I’d been working on it since 2012ish when I worked as a freelancer and had plenty of free time to implement my own systems… and importantly, work under my own time frame. It’s hard to own organization when jira tickets change every day, keeping you off balance… not even work duplicating the data in. (Just show up to work during a normal schedule and say no to your boss as much as possible.)</p>
